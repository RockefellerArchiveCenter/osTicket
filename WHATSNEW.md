osTicket 1.10
==================
## Major New Features

### Internationalization, Phase III
![screen shot 2014-10-18 at 11 40 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/4692086/b16b1474-574a-11e4-89e7-b871ff591802.png)

Phase III of the internationalization project is the next major advancement of
osTicket language support. The greatest improvement is that all
administratively customizable content. While this is a great last mile for many
multilingual support teams, we've also revisited the client interface main
pages as well as the knowledge base on both the client and staff panels.

  * Elect primary and secondary languages
    * Any language can be the primary, any number of languages can be secondary
    * English-US can be disabled
    * Order of secondary languages is sortable and controls flag order
  * All content is translatable to secondary languages
      * Help Topics
        * Alphabetic sorting happens after translation
      * SLA Plans
      * Departments
      * Custom Forms (and all configurations such as placeholders)
      * Custom Lists
        * Items
        * Properties and configurations
      * Site Pages
      * FAQ Categories
      * FAQ Articles
        * Common attachments (available for all translations)
        * Per-language attachments
      * Content such as welcome emails and password-reset emails
  * Olson timezones are used instead of GMT offset
    * Auto-detect support for agent and client timezone
  * Time and date formats can be automatic by locale preference now.
    * Locale preference is the default
    * Locale preference with forced 24-hour time is also an option
    * Advanced format is also possible using the intl library and `sprintf` as a backup
    * Formats including the day of the week are localized
    * Chinese and Arabic formats using alternate day, month, and year digits and separators are now automatic.
  * Client portal has HTML headers indicate search engine links to pages of other
    languages, as well as the Content-Header HTTP header to indicate the intended
    audience
  * Spell check in text boxes, textareas and rich text editors should respect the
    language of the content being edited

### Tasks
![screen shot 2015-05-06 at 12 36 14 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7616658/c5147c68-f96b-11e4-85b7-e74a3482bb4f.png)

Tasks are sub-tickets which can be created and attached to tickets as well as
created separately. Tasks have their own assignees, department routing and
visibility, due date, and custom data. Tasks have their own threads and can
have a list of collaborators. All in all, tasks may very well be the greatest
advancement of osTicket since the advent of the ticket itself.

### New Advanced Search
![screen shot 2015-05-13 at 12 35 15 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7616759/94616a1c-f96c-11e4-8c19-ae1ca26a85c0.png)

The advanced search feature is rewritten to address several  shortcomings of
the original feature as well as a host of new features including
  * Search by any field, built-in or custom
  * Save your searches
  * Advanced search is shown as a new queue
  * Current advanced search criteria is maintained between searches
  * Sorting options are relevant to queue and preference remains after navigation between queues

## Minor New Features

### Thread editing
![screen shot 2015-03-20 at 6 56 10 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/6762680/ce4e78a0-cf32-11e4-9316-c0a969e9c70a.png)

Thread items can now be edited. The original entries are preserved and are
accessible via a thread item's "History". Items can be resent with or without
editing them, and a signature selection is available when resending.

### Roles, and custom extended access
![screen shot 2015-05-03 at 9 05 12 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7448163/257ce586-f1d8-11e4-8ed8-a11324d13027.png)

The group permissions component has been offloaded to a new component, named
"Roles". Roles allow for naming a set of permissions. Agents now have a
"Primary Role" which defines their access to global things like the user
directory and their access for their primary department. Each department
granted via "Groups" is allows to be linked to a distinct "Role". This allows
granting Read-Only access to some departments, for instance.

### Improved knowledge base interface
![screen shot 2014-10-18 at 11 55 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/4692123/5ec01038-574c-11e4-80a7-7e8a8efe3963.png)
  * "Featured" articles show on the front page
  * Knowledge base search on front page
  * Translatable content
  * Locale-specific attachments

### Multiple forms and disable individual fields for Help Topics
Help Topic configuration has a new super feature. Multiple forms can now be
associated with each help topic, and the order the forms should appear for new
tickets and editing tickets is configurable. Previously, the custom forms were
always rendered above the "Ticket Details" form; but now it's completely
customizable. What's more is that individual fields **including the issue
details** can be disabled for any help topic.

### Department hierarchy
Departments are now nestable. All departments can have a parent department, and
the hierarchy is arbitrarily nestable. Access is cascaded so that access to a
parent department automatically extends access to all descendent departments.

### Image annotation
![screen shot 2015-05-04 at 9 07 38 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7466027/ac34575c-f2a1-11e4-9335-417960f89334.png)

Images can be annotated to add simple shapes like ovals, boxes, arrows and
text. Annotates can be committed, and a new image is created from the
annotations; however, annotations can still be edited before the thread post is
submitted. Annotations are supported for both clients and agents, and the
images can be selected from the ticket thread, so images already posted can be
easily marked up.

### Variable context type-ahead
![screen shot 2015-04-20 at 4 32 58 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7240963/ee930d8c-e77a-11e4-8928-26240274db13.png)

When editing content which uses variables, such as a thank-you page or an email
template, variable placeholders now use a type-ahead feature. This new pop out
significantly improves the connection between which variables are available in
which templates. It also allows for adding significantly to the variable
library without relying on exhaustive documentation to convey this information.
Some new variables include
  * User lists, such as department members, team members, and collaborator lists
  * Lists can be rendered as names, emails, or both
  * Dates are format-able to time, short, full, and long
  * Dates can be humanized to something like *in about an hour*
  * Dates can be auto localized and formatted to the recipients locale and time
    zone selection
  * Attachments to thread items and custom fields can be attached via variable
    (e.g. `%{message.files}`)

### Redesigned list management
![Simplified, tabular, paginated view of list items, with mass actions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/5881786/3040d162-a309-11e4-9529-8ae51d358f81.png)

The list management feature has a significant overhaul to accommodate larger
lists. It also provides a heads display of list item properties as well as AJAX
updates. CSV import and pagination have also been added as well as mass enable,
disable, and delete.

### Pluggable filter actions
![screen shot 2015-05-04 at 8 59 32 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/672074/7465977/801b4cbc-f2a0-11e4-9598-95dd52e79e82.png)

Filter actions are now far more flexible allowing for more elaborate and
creative filter actions to be created. A new filter action has been added as an
example of future possibilities: send an email. The new feature allows for
ticket filter actions to be defined without modification to internal table
structures, and even allows actions to be created via plugins!

Actions are also sortable and performed in the order specified, which allows
doing something like sending an email before rejecting the ticket.

### Other Improvements
#### Custom Data
* Fields have more granular access configuration. View, edit, and requirement
  can be enabled individually for both agents and end users
* Fields can be marked for required for closed. Therefore they can inhibit
  closure of a ticket without a valid value.

#### Export
The agent's locale is considered when exporting CSV and semicolon separators
are used where necessary

#### User Interface
The subject line and many other text fields around the system are truncated by
the browser, which fixes early truncation for some language with long Unicode
byte stream, such as Chinese.

#### Improved lock system
The ticket lock system uses a code now which is rotated when updates to tickets
are submitted. This helps prevent unwanted extra posts to tickets. A new
annoying popup is displayed when viewing the ticket and the lock is about to
expire.

#### Draft system
The draft system has been rewritten to reduce the number of requests to the
backend and to reduce the dreaded "Unable to save draft" popup

#### ORM
The database query system is being redesigned to use an object relational
mapper (ORM) instead of SQL queries. This will eventually lead to fewer
database queries to use the system, cleaner code, and will allow the use of
database engines other than MySQL. The ORM was originally introduced in

### Merged from v1.8.0.2
  * Log entry for password reset attempts (#435)

osTicket v1.8.1 (Preview)
=========================
### Collaborator Support (CC)
In addition to the ticket owner, other end users can be collaborators on a
ticket. Responses received from them are integrated automatically into the
ticket thread, and emails are sent to all collaborators when new messages and
responses arrive into the system. All collaborators have access to the ticket
via the client portal and are able to log new messages.

### Plugin management system
osTicket supports plugins via a (currently undocumented) simple plugin API and
interface. Plugins can be written and distributed as files or unpacked via ZIP
archives, or distributed via PHP PHAR files. The plugin system is developed in
hopes of adding extensibility to osTicket without significant overhead.
Initially, two "classes" of plugins are supported: authentication, and file
storage.

### Pluggable authentication
Staff members can now be authenticated against a backend other than the
osTicket internal database. Available immediately is integration with LDAP
(RFC-2307) and Microsoft® Active Directory. The initial authentication system
also support user lookups, so when browsing for new users when creating
tickets, your directory server will be queried for users and email addresses.

### Pluggable attachment storage
Attachments can live outside the database again. You can now write or install a
plugin to store your attachments somewhere other than in your database, and
osTicket will use the backend to store and retrieve (or redirect to) your
attachments. We've initially made a plugin available to store attachments on
the filesystem and plan on adding an Amazon S3 plugin very soon.

### Internationalization, Phase 1
Select your default data on installation, and select the language preference,
as a staff member, for the help tips. You can also now select the language of
the email templates when creating a new template. The templates for that
language will be used instead of the English ones where translated versions are
available.

### Rich Text Ticket Thread
As an option, enabled by default, osTicket can now process HTML email and
allows for rich text markup in most long-answer boxes across the system,
including staff replies and internal notes posted to the ticket thread. To keep
the feature consistent throughout, canned responses and email templates also
sport an HTML theme now.

### Custom Forms and Fields
The data collected from your users when they fill out the ticket form is now
customizable. You can now ask any information relevant to your business
practice, and can customize the type of input show from the user. Currently,
short and long answer fields, drop-down lists, checkboxes, date and time, and
phone number fields are available. Each field is configurable and can be setup
according to your liking. Fields can also be marked as required, whose input is
required to submit the ticket, and internal, whose input is not visible to the
end user.

New Features in 1.7
===================
Version 1.7 includes several new features

Ticket Filters
-------------
As an upgrade from email banning (which is still supported), ticket filters
allow for matching incoming email in the subject line and message body. For
matching emails, the administrator has the ability to automatically route
tickets:

  * To a specific department, staff member, and/or team
  * Automatically assign ticket priority and/or service-level-agreement
  * Disable ticket auto-responses
  * Send automatic canned responses

Tickets filters are also applied to tickets submitted via all ticket
interfaces, including the API, email, staff and client web interfaces. And,
as a bonus, the filters can be configured to target only a single interface.
So an administrator could, for instance, target tickets received via email
from a particular domain.

Canned Attachments
------------------
Attach files to your canned responses. These attachments are automatically
attached to the ticket thread along with the canned response. The
attachments are not duplicated in the database and therefore use virtually
no space.

Database-backed Attachments
---------------------------
No more crazy security-related configuration to your host server in order to
support attachments. Attachments are now quietly stored in the database. The
upgrade migration will automatically port attachments from the previous
locations into the database.

Service Level Agreements
------------------------
Service level agreements allow for a configurable grace period based on the
department or help topic associated with the ticket. A default SLA is
provided, and a due date can be set to override the grace period of the SLA
for a ticket.

Client-side Knowledgebase
-------------------------
Manage a searchable help document portal for your users

Dashboard Reports
-----------------
Flashy reports of ticket system activity as well as exportable ticket system
statistics, allowing for easy report generation from office spreadsheet
applications.

Ticket Export
-------------
Convert the ticket thread to a printed format for long term storage. The
ticket view page now supports a print feature, which will render the ticket
as a PDF document.

API
---
Interface with osTicket via HTTP requests. Starting with version 1.7,
tickets are createable by submitting an HTTP POST request to either

    /api/tickets.xml
    /api/tickets.json

The API can also be used to pipe emails into the osTicket system. Use the
included `automail.php` or `automail.pl` script to pipe emails to the
system, or post raw email messages directly to

    /api/tickets.email

Use of the API requires an API key, which can be created and configured in
the admin panel of the support system.

For technical details, please refer to [API Docs] (setup/doc/api.md).

Geeky New Features
==================

Unicode
-------
Better and more consistent international text handling

Flexible Template Variables
---------------------------
Template variables have been redesigned to be more flexible. They have been
integrated into the respective object classes so that an object as well as
its properties can be represented in template variables. For instance
%{ticket.staff.name}
